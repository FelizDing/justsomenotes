# If it is nd2 images not movies, I need to convert .nd2 file to .png instead of mp4. Use fiji function: Processing ->Batch ->Macro
# After obtaining the PNGs, go to the folder that contains the PNGs, and do the following:
 echo "<html><body>$(ls *.png | awk '{print "<img src=\""$1"\" style=\"margin-right:5px;\" width=\"220\">"}')</body></html>" > look_at_me.html
# after getting htmls I can export and save them as PDF

# If it is nd2 images not movies, I need to convert .nd2 file to .png instead of mp4. Use fiji function: Processing ->Batch ->Macro
# After obtaining the PNGs, go to the folder that contains the PNGs, and do the following:
 echo "<html><body>$(ls *.png | awk '{print "<img src=\""$1"\" style=\"margin-right:5px;\" width=\"220\">"}')</body></html>" > look_at_me.html
# after getting htmls I can export and save them as PDF

# If the above does not work, alternatively, try:
printf "<html><body>" > look_at_me.html
for file in *.png; do
    printf "<img src=\"%s\" style=\"margin-right:5px; margin-bottom:10px;\" width=\"200\">" "$file" >> look_at_me.html
done
printf "</body></html>" >> look_at_me.html
